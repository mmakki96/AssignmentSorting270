We are going to sort 50 integers in quick, merge, selection sorting

Selection Sort: O(n^2)
comparision:  (n^2)/2 == O(n^2)
Time Stemps for selection Sort is: 0.051652 milli Seconds
Number of Comparision of Selection Sort: 1225

Merge Sort: O(n*lgn)
comparisions: (n^2)/2;
Time Stemps for Merge Sort is: 0.065821 milli Seconds
Number of Comparision of Merge Sort: 1105

Quick Sort: O(n*lgn)
comparisions: (n^2)/3 == O(n*lgn)
Time Stemps for Quick Sort is: 0.042807 milli Seconds
Number of Comparision of Quick Sort: 510

Quick sort seems to be the best preforming one, 
2nd best is merge sort
Worst sorting time seems to be selection sort
